a simple cli tool that helps you block `git push` to remote. 

## why?

I, personally, have a bad habbit of running `git push` right after making a commit. This, sometimes, results in broken deployments in my personal projects. This tool helps me lock my repo so I do not acccidentally push something to remote.
